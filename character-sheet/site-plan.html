			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>I want to make a more visually appealing character sheet for a table top RPG game I'm playing with friends online. It would be a place for me to easily reference all the essential details of my character including stats, level, HP, etc. in a way that is more visually pleasing than the current sheet we use.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>I am the primary audience, but I could also share this template with my friends so they could fill out their own character details.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I want to be able to manage my health and other stats that will change during the course of a normal game session. I would also like a toggleable button that allows me to make edits to things like level and character stats that will change only sometimes. I'd like to add a radar chart that adjusts dynamically with my character stats if possible. In my second page I want to be able to type notes in and then add them to the page.</p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/241200-ffc266-ffdb9a-ff9b00"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/241200-ffc266-ffdb9a-ff9b00</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#FFC266]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#241200]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#FFDB9A]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#FF9B00]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Sixtyfour
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Courier Prime
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Notes</a>
			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<img src="shipLogo.png">
			<p>Character info and stats for the character formatted from a js file. Radar chart to display the stats visually.</p>
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<img src="shipLogo.png">
			<p>Text entry area and a display scetion for the notes that are added to the a list from the text entry.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				Most of the details will be filled out by js objects, but this is the structure.
			</p>
			<img src="MainWireframe.jpg" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>
				The title and nav will be the same as the home, I just didn't draw it again.
